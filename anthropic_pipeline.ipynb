According to the present invention, an artificial small interfering peptide (a-siPEP) as a truncated from of the transcription factor for regulating transcription by dimerization was produced.

      "PatentData(text='The economic efficiency of wind turbines improves by upscaling but the weight to strength ratio deteriorates. This is especially true for the large shaft and bearing of the rotor, the gearbox and the generator. Solutions to this was the gearless generator, getting heavy because the amount of magnetic material is inversely proportional to speed, or several smaller generators adapted to the wind on a distribution gear as shown in references (1), (2) and (3). The large roller bearing of the rotor has relatively large bearing clearance so only the top or lower rollers bear the entire weight of the rotor and thus must be dimensioned relatively large. The present invention spreads the load on the support bearing to more rollers and to smaller faster running and thereby lighter generators. It has the rotor attached to the outer ring, each roller rotatably mounted to the nacelle and the inner ring free wheeling. The outer and inner rings are relatively stiffer than the rotatable fixation of the upper rollers to the nacelle, so that the upper rollers flex slightly down under the weight of the rotor allowing some of the force of gravity to be transferred to the inner ring and on to the bottom relatively stiff journalled rollers. Gear teeth can be used to transfer torque to all rollers, or the inner ring pressed against the side rollers, or the conical rollers can be pressed dynamically in between the outer and inner ring with relatively constant force. This is shown in FIGS. 1 and 6 in perspective and FIG. 2 and FIG. 3, in radial section. The relatively small roller shafts can now be used as PTO with gear ratio bearing diameter to roller diameter. The cost of the extra bearings for each roller is offset by savings in the usual center shaft and gear. Also, the friction from the edge of the outer or inner ring to keep the large rollers in place is missing. These benefits are especially important for wind turbines with heavy hub, axle and gear on a tall tower, and large wing rotor bearing clearance causing inappropriate vibrations of the long components. With no central hub shaft, gear and generator in the nacelle center there is space for force carrying structures as strong as the top of the tower to a point on the centre line of the rotor in front of it. To this a bearing for sustaining the varying moments of the wind can be affixed so the weight carrying bearing and gear unit can be designed cylindrical; or stays can be continued to other tower elements achieving a tower structure with significantly lower weight and higher natural frequency than usual wind moment influenced single column towers.', image=<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=3000x2470 at 0x7F542C7E1090>, label='F03D', model_output=None, messages=None, model_type='claude3haiku', mode=2)\n"

During anti-lock control, in contrast, a pressure-increase linear valve and a pressure-reduction linear valve are opened, allowing change in volume of the control pressure chamber, resulting in reduction in stiffness. This reduction suppresses vibrations of a hydraulic pressure in the control pressure chamber, resulting in suppression of vibrations of a hydraulic pressure in a front pressure chamber. As a result, it is possible to reduce the lowering in control accuracy for a hydraulic pressure in a brake cylinder in anti-lock control using the hydraulic pressure in the front pressure chamber, which can well avoid a long braking distance.', image=<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=3000x2029 at 0x7F542C7DDB10>, label='B60T', model_output=None, messages=None, model_type='claude3haiku', mode=2)\n"

      "PatentData(text='The economic efficiency of wind turbines improves by upscaling but the weight to strength ratio deteriorates. This is especially true for the large shaft and bearing of the rotor, the gearbox and the generator. Solutions to this was the gearless generator, getting heavy because the amount of magnetic material is inversely proportional to speed, or several smaller generators adapted to the wind on a distribution gear as shown in references (1), (2) and (3). The large roller bearing of the rotor has relatively large bearing clearance so only the top or lower rollers bear the entire weight of the rotor and thus must be dimensioned relatively large. The present invention spreads the load on the support bearing to more rollers and to smaller faster running and thereby lighter generators. It has the rotor attached to the outer ring, each roller rotatably mounted to the nacelle and the inner ring free wheeling. The outer and inner rings are relatively stiffer than the rotatable fixation of the upper rollers to the nacelle, so that the upper rollers flex slightly down under the weight of the rotor allowing some of the force of gravity to be transferred to the inner ring and on to the bottom relatively stiff journalled rollers. Gear teeth can be used to transfer torque to all rollers, or the inner ring pressed against the side rollers, or the conical rollers can be pressed dynamically in between the outer and inner ring with relatively constant force. This is shown in FIGS. 1 and 6 in perspective and FIG. 2 and FIG. 3, in radial section. The relatively small roller shafts can now be used as PTO with gear ratio bearing diameter to roller diameter. The cost of the extra bearings for each roller is offset by savings in the usual center shaft and gear. Also, the friction from the edge of the outer or inner ring to keep the large rollers in place is missing. These benefits are especially important for wind turbines with heavy hub, axle and gear on a tall tower, and large wing rotor bearing clearance causing inappropriate vibrations of the long components. With no central hub shaft, gear and generator in the nacelle center there is space for force carrying structures as strong as the top of the tower to a point on the centre line of the rotor in front of it. To this a bearing for sustaining the varying moments of the wind can be affixed so the weight carrying bearing and gear unit can be designed cylindrical; or stays can be continued to other tower elements achieving a tower structure with significantly lower weight and higher natural frequency than usual wind moment influenced single column towers.', image=None, label='F03D', model_output=None, messages=None, model_type='claude3haiku', mode=1)\n"

Using an APC loop with an additional burst-mode control circuit, and a switch in series with a diode and in parallel with the laser, a continuous-mode laser driver is enabled to operate in burst-mode by turning the switch on or off via external logic. Burst-mode control manages the switch, and a bandwidth-select circuit using a high or low logic level input, wherein the laser is disabled and the bandwidth-select circuit enters a fast-track mode when the external logic signal has a first level. The laser provides regular optical signals, and the bandwidth-select circuit enters a slow-track mode, thereby enabling the APC loop to operate normally, when the external logic signal has a second level. In addition to a low cost and simple implementation, the control circuit and method provide lasers with a fast response capability using one or more externally-controlled switch circuits to meet demands of PON systems for burst-mode ONUs.', image=<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=2101x3000 at 0x7F5426BEBB50>, label='H04B', model_output=None, messages=None, model_type='claude3haiku', mode=0)\n"
