      "PatentData(text='The economic efficiency of wind turbines improves by upscaling but the weight to strength ratio deteriorates. This is especially true for the large shaft and bearing of the rotor, the gearbox and the generator. Solutions to this was the gearless generator, getting heavy because the amount of magnetic material is inversely proportional to speed, or several smaller generators adapted to the wind on a distribution gear as shown in references (1), (2) and (3). The large roller bearing of the rotor has relatively large bearing clearance so only the top or lower rollers bear the entire weight of the rotor and thus must be dimensioned relatively large. The present invention spreads the load on the support bearing to more rollers and to smaller faster running and thereby lighter generators. It has the rotor attached to the outer ring, each roller rotatably mounted to the nacelle and the inner ring free wheeling. The outer and inner rings are relatively stiffer than the rotatable fixation of the upper rollers to the nacelle, so that the upper rollers flex slightly down under the weight of the rotor allowing some of the force of gravity to be transferred to the inner ring and on to the bottom relatively stiff journalled rollers. Gear teeth can be used to transfer torque to all rollers, or the inner ring pressed against the side rollers, or the conical rollers can be pressed dynamically in between the outer and inner ring with relatively constant force. This is shown in FIGS. 1 and 6 in perspective and FIG. 2 and FIG. 3, in radial section. The relatively small roller shafts can now be used as PTO with gear ratio bearing diameter to roller diameter. The cost of the extra bearings for each roller is offset by savings in the usual center shaft and gear. Also, the friction from the edge of the outer or inner ring to keep the large rollers in place is missing. These benefits are especially important for wind turbines with heavy hub, axle and gear on a tall tower, and large wing rotor bearing clearance causing inappropriate vibrations of the long components. With no central hub shaft, gear and generator in the nacelle center there is space for force carrying structures as strong as the top of the tower to a point on the centre line of the rotor in front of it. To this a bearing for sustaining the varying moments of the wind can be affixed so the weight carrying bearing and gear unit can be designed cylindrical; or stays can be continued to other tower elements achieving a tower structure with significantly lower weight and higher natural frequency than usual wind moment influenced single column towers.', image=<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=3000x2470 at 0x7F0F424BF4D0>, label='F03D', model_output=None, messages=None, model_type='gpt4v', mode=2, original_images=None, original_data_obj=None)\n"

      "PatentData(text='The economic efficiency of wind turbines improves by upscaling but the weight to strength ratio deteriorates. This is especially true for the large shaft and bearing of the rotor, the gearbox and the generator. Solutions to this was the gearless generator, getting heavy because the amount of magnetic material is inversely proportional to speed, or several smaller generators adapted to the wind on a distribution gear as shown in references (1), (2) and (3). The large roller bearing of the rotor has relatively large bearing clearance so only the top or lower rollers bear the entire weight of the rotor and thus must be dimensioned relatively large. The present invention spreads the load on the support bearing to more rollers and to smaller faster running and thereby lighter generators. It has the rotor attached to the outer ring, each roller rotatably mounted to the nacelle and the inner ring free wheeling. The outer and inner rings are relatively stiffer than the rotatable fixation of the upper rollers to the nacelle, so that the upper rollers flex slightly down under the weight of the rotor allowing some of the force of gravity to be transferred to the inner ring and on to the bottom relatively stiff journalled rollers. Gear teeth can be used to transfer torque to all rollers, or the inner ring pressed against the side rollers, or the conical rollers can be pressed dynamically in between the outer and inner ring with relatively constant force. This is shown in FIGS. 1 and 6 in perspective and FIG. 2 and FIG. 3, in radial section. The relatively small roller shafts can now be used as PTO with gear ratio bearing diameter to roller diameter. The cost of the extra bearings for each roller is offset by savings in the usual center shaft and gear. Also, the friction from the edge of the outer or inner ring to keep the large rollers in place is missing. These benefits are especially important for wind turbines with heavy hub, axle and gear on a tall tower, and large wing rotor bearing clearance causing inappropriate vibrations of the long components. With no central hub shaft, gear and generator in the nacelle center there is space for force carrying structures as strong as the top of the tower to a point on the centre line of the rotor in front of it. To this a bearing for sustaining the varying moments of the wind can be affixed so the weight carrying bearing and gear unit can be designed cylindrical; or stays can be continued to other tower elements achieving a tower structure with significantly lower weight and higher natural frequency than usual wind moment influenced single column towers.', image=None, label='F03D', model_output=None, messages=None, model_type='gpt4v', mode=1)\n"
